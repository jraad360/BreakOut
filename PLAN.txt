After looking at the different variants of Breakout, one thing I noticed that every game
implemented is that depending the speed and direction in at which the paddle hits the ball and the
location at which the paddle is hit, the angle at which the ball bounces off changes. This makes
skill more important for the game since the player now has the ability to decide the optimal
direction to aim the ball in. If the paddle simply reverses the angle of the ball, then the only
thing the player has to worry about is that the paddle is in position in time to hit the ball.

One thing that caught my attention is how in "Centipong", the screen would display "Now drop the
pods" after the level was cleared. It's not clear if touching a pod in this state will harm the
player or just prolong the game, but it gave me the idea of having the bouncers enter a state in
which it would harm the player to touch them.

LEVELS
Level 1 - The first level will be very easy. The blocks will be placed all together towards the top
of the screen. Every type of power-up will be present to introduce their effects. It will look
something like this:
_____________
|oooooooooooo|
|oooooooooooo|
|oooooooooooo|
|            |
|            |
|            |
|            |
|            |
|            |
_____________

Level 2 - The bouncers speed up. The second level will have a few blocks in the way, closer to
the paddle. This level will also introduce the poison block. More of the blocks will need to be
hit multiples times to be broken.

_____________
|oooooooooooo|
|oooooooooooo|
|oooooooooooo|
|            |
|            |
| o   o   o  |
|            |
|   o   o    |
|            |
_____________

Level 3 - The bouncers speed up again. The final level will have several of the strongest blocks
placed very close to the paddle. There will also be multiple poison blocks. Every level ends with
the remaining bouncers entering poison mode, but for the last level, the player will have to
survive for twice as long.

TYPES OF BLOCKS
I would create three different blocks that need to be hit either 1, 2, or 3 times to be broken. I
would need to implement a visual aid that indicates how close the blocks are to breaking (such as
cracks).

Another block I could create is an "explosive" block which a player would be hesitant to break.
When this block is hit, it launches the ball back at double speed. Once the ball hits something,
it would return to normal speed.

Another block I will create, the "poison" block, will cause all the bouncers to change color and
become deadly. The bouncers will not fall off the screen in this mode. They will return to normal
after a few seconds. This will make players second-guess hitting the ball-multiplier power-up if
this block is still in play.

Another block will drop an item that will cause the paddle to freeze for a few seconds.

EXTRA FEATURES
* Ability to switch the ball's appearance. I think that allowing the player to customize the game
makes it more fun to play. This way, players will be able to clear the levels in style.

* Poison Mode - whether triggered by a block or at the end of the level, when the bouncers are in
this mode, they will take a life from the player and will not fall off the screen. I think this is
creative and also fun because of how unexpected it is. It can also make losing more painful (and
conversely, winning more rewarding) because after spending time beating the whole level, the player
is confronted with an unexpected and difficult final stage they must clear before moving on.
Eliminating all the blocks just to be taken out by this final stage can be very frustrating.

* Hot Streak - If the paddle is hit in the middle a certain number of times in a row, the ball
becomes stuck to the paddle, giving the player a few seconds to readjust the paddle. After a few
seconds, the ball will bounce directly upwards from the paddle. This streak also adds points to your
score. This gives players a clear way to beat their high scores when playing through the game again.
It also gives players another objective to focus on within the game. These streaks give players
another way to beat their high scores and can also be very satisfying.
